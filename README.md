# Calculator

Calculator is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) consisting of a calculator with UI written in JavaScript.

To build this project, I used knowledge of everything I learned from JavaScript Basics including DOM manipulation, event listeners, HTML Foundations and CSS Foundations including Flexbox.
